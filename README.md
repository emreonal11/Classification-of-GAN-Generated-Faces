# Classification-of-GAN-Generated-Faces
Used a convolutional neural network architecture to classify GAN-generated faces. The GANs explored were PGGAN and StyleGAN2 pretrained on the CelebFaces dataset. The classification network classified each face under the labels ['CelebFaces', 'PGGAN', 'StyleGAN']. The best performing classification model made use of 3x3 laplacian filtering for image pre-processing and a minibatch standard deviation layer in the network, achieving a 99.7% accuracy on the 3000 image test dataset. Further details can be found in the Project Report file.
